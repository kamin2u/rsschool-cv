### Summary
 
---

My previous professional experience was related to public sector management and scientific, expert and educational activities in the field of public administration. However, I have always been interested in the IT world, I follow the most important news in certain areas of IT & Tech. Even in my professional environment, in recent years, I have been trying to develop myself in the field of digital transformation of Government and Public Administration. I'm going through thematic training programs and improving my knowledge and skills in this area. 
I think I can call myself an advanced user of the iOS and macOS ecosystem. I love to explore and compare many new applications, and often participate in beta testing programs for operating systems and applications. 
I really want to learn how to create iOS applications because I often see imperfections in the services and applications used. I am well motivated to study and self-study, I believe that participation in RS.School will give the effective start to my journey into the world of iOS development.
